# Unsupervised Ingredient Substitution Model
To get started, create an instance of the Substitution class passing it the path of the directory containing the needed files. It takes around 15 minutes for it to initialize. You can then pass a list of ingredient strings to ```get_substitutions()```
to get suggestions in the form of:
```
{
  'from': ...
  'to': ...
  'confidence': ...
  'ghg_difference': ...
}
```

Take a look at demo.py for a simple example application of the model. It takes in a string of ingredients (for example “flour cinnamon salt baking powder egg sugar vegetable oil vanilla walnut”) of any format and outputs the suggestions.
